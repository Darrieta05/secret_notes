# Database Tech in the project

## SQLite3

Serverless database

Benefits:
- Portable
- quick lightweight

Cons:
- No User Management
- Limited concurrency

## MySQL

Benefits:
- Popularity
- Security
- Speed

# PostgreSQL
" The most advanced open-source database in the world" 

Benefits:
- OpenSource
- Extensible

Cons:
- Memory Performance
- Popularity ( worse than Mysql)

# Conclusion 

I believe the best option for this small app is to have an SQLite3 database. If we want to expand this as a cloud service then it would probably migrate to use Mysql and/or NoSQL services to store data.
